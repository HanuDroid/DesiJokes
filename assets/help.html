<h1>Getting Started</h1>
Thankyou for downloading this app. This application is very user friendly and does not need any help. However, for your reference, we have documented some information that you may need.

<h3>Navigation:</h3>
Just swipe to right / left on the screen to navigate to next / previous joke.<br>
Switch to landscape layout to access a list of all jokes at a time.

<h3>Parental Control:</h3>
We understand that some times children have access to parent's devices and this is the reason we added Parental control feature to this app. <br>
The application will be launched only when the user enters a secret password. The password can be set in the Settings screen.<br>
Use the menu option to go to the settings screen.<br>
If you forget the password, then un-install and install the application again.

<h1>Report bugs</h1>
