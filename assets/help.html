You can delete jokes that you don't like. <br>
However, please note that once you delete a joke, you wont be able to view it again.
If you wish to view deleted jokes again, then un-install and re-install the app. OR drop us an email so that we can push all jokes to your mobile once again.

<h3>Parental Control:</h3>
We understand that some times children have access to parent's devices and this is the reason we added Parental control feature to this app. <br>
The application will be launched only when the user enters a secret password. The password can be set in the Settings screen.<br>
Use the menu option to go to the settings screen.<br>
If you forget the password, then un-install and install the application again.
