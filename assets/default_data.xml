<PostContent><![CDATA[A man is out shopping and discovers a new brand of Olympic condoms. Clearly impressed, he buys a pack. <br />
<br />
Upon getting home he announces to his wife the purchase he just made. "Olympic condoms?"<br />
<br />
she blurts, "What makes them so special?" <br />
"There is three colors", he replies, "Gold, Silver and Bronze." <br />
"What color are you going to wear tonight?", she asks cheekily. <br />
"Gold of course", says the man proudly. <br />
<br />
The wife responds really, "Why don't you wear Silver, it would be nice if you came second for a change!".]]></PostContent>

<br />
The preacher who lived across the street saw the beer and came over to harass the kid. "Aren't you a little young to be drinking, son?" he asked. <br />
<br />
"That's nothing," the kid said after taking a swig of beer. "I got laid when I was three." <br />
<br />
"What? How did that happen?" <br />
<br />
"I don't remember. I was drunk."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Long n deadly</PostTitle>

<PostContent><![CDATA[Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years. <br />
<br />
He eventually decides to go and see a doctor. The doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration.<br />
<br />
You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.<br />
<br />
Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. <br />
<br />
As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new suit.' <br />
He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new suit.' The elderly tailor eye d him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.' <br />
Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' <br />
'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said. <br />
<br />
Joe tried on the suit it fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?' <br />
Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.' The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.' <br />
Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' 'Been in the business 60 years.' <br />
Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly. <br />
<br />
Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new underwear?' Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..' The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36. Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..' <br />
The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache...<br />
<br />
New suit - $400 <br />
New shirt - $36 <br />
New underwear - $6 <br />
Second Opinion - PRICELESS.]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A man gets his fiance, Wendy's name tattooed on his penis. So when he's hard it says "Wendy," but when it's soft it just says, "W Y."<br />
<br />
So they get married and go to Jamaica on their honeymoon. They're dancing in the club and drinking and having a good time when inevitably the man has to go to the bathroom.<br />

He's standing at the urinal and notices a big tall jamaican guy next to him has "W Y" tattooed on his penis.<br />
<br />
The newlywed says, "Excuse me, but I noticed you have "W Y" on your penis.<br />
<br />
The Jamaican replies, "Ya mon. I see you have it too.. Tell me mon, what does yours say when it's hard?"<br />
<br />
The man says proudly, "When mine's hard, it says 'Wendy'. What does yours say?"<br />
<br />
The jamaican says, "Ah Mon, when mine is hard it says 'Welcome to the island of Jamaica, Have a nice day!"]]></PostContent>

</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A 70 year old man went to his doctor's office to get a sperm count. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, "Take this jar home and bring me back a sample tomorrow." The next day the 70 year old man reappears at the doctor's office and gives him the jar, which is as clean and empty as on - the previous day.<br />
<br />
The doctor asked what happened and the man explains: "Well, doc, it's like this: First I tried with my right hand, but, nothing. Then I tried with-my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She - tried with her right hand, with nothing. Then her left, but nothing. She - even tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with the teeth-out, and still nothing. We even called up the lady next door and-she tried with both hands and her mouth too, but nothing."<br />
<br />
The doctor was shocked! "You asked your neighbor?"<br />
the old man replied, "yep, but no matter what we tried we couldn't get the DARN jar open!"]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>do you have a vagina?</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A woman is at home when she hears someone knock at the door. <br />
<br />
She goes to the door and opens the door to see a innocent man standing there.<br />
<br />
He asks the lady, 'Do you have a vagina?'<br />
<br />
She slams the door in disgust.<br />
<br />
The next morning she hears a knock at the door and it is the same man and he asks the same question of the woman, 'Do you have a vagina?'<br />
<br />
She slams the door again.<br />
<br />
Later that night when her husband gets home she tells him what has happened for the last two days.<br />
<br />
The husband tells the wife in a loving and concerned voice 'Honey, I am taking tomorrow off to be home just in case this guy shows up again.'<br />
<br />
The next morning they hear a knock and both run for the door.<br />
<br />
The husband says to the wife in a whispered voice, 'Honey, I'm going to hide behind the door and listen and if it is the same guy I want you to answer yes to the question because I want to see where the bastard is going with it.'<br />
<br />
She nods yes to her husband and opens the door. Sure enough the same fellow is standing there and asks the same question; 'Do you have a vagina'?<br />
<br />
'Yes, actually I have,' she says... <br />
<br />
The man replies.. 'Good! Would you mind telling your husband to leave my wife's alone and start using yours?'?]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[On their first night to be together, the newlywed couple go to get changed. <br />
<br />
The new bride comes out of the bathroom, all showered and wearing her beautiful robe. <br />
The proud husband says, "My dear, we are married now, you can open your robe."<br />
The beautiful young woman opens her robe, and he is astonished. "Oh, oh, aaaahhh," he exclaims, "My word, you are so beautiful, let me take your picture. Puzzled, she asks, "My picture?"<br />
He answers, "Yes my dear, so I can carry your beauty next to my heart forever."<br />
She smiles and he takes her picture, and then he heads into the bathroom to shower.<br />
He comes out wearing his robe and the new wife asks, "Why do you wear a robe? We are married now."<br />
At that the man opens his robe and she exclaims, "Oh, oh, oh my, let me get a picture."<br />
He beams and asks, "Why?" She answers, "So I can get it enlarged."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>two black eyes</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Jack was returning to work Monday morning with two black eyes. <br />
<br />
His workmates were understandably curious: "Jack, what happened to you ??" <br />
<br />
"It was the darndest thing! I was at church yesterday, and this fat lady stood up in front of me. You know how a dress can get stuck in the crack of the butt of a fat lady? It looked funny. I figured she wouldn't like that, so I just reached over and pulled it out with a little tug. Next thing I know, she spins around and socks me one!"<br />
<br />
"Jeez, you got TWO black eyes in one blow?"<br />
<br />
"Naw. After she turned back around, I figured she was angry that I pulled the dress out of her crack, so I tried to poke it back in..."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>A damn good explanation</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[The wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman And she was upset.<br />
<br />
'You are a disrespectful pig!' she cried. 'How dare you do this to me -- a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I'm leaving you.<br />
<br />
I want a divorce right away ! And the husband replied, 'Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.<br />
<br />
'Go ahead,' she sobbed,' but they'll be the last words you'll say to me!'<br />
<br />
And the husband began -- 'Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift.<br />
<br />
She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.<br />
<br />
I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty.<br />
<br />
She told me that she hadn't eaten for three days.<br />
<br />
So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night, the ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight.<br />
<br />
The poor thing devoured them in moments.<br />
<br />
Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away.<br />
<br />
Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.<br />
<br />
I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't wear because I don't have good taste.<br />
<br />
I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair the same.<br />
<br />
'The husband took a quick breath and continued - 'She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, 'Please, Do you have Anything else that your wife doesn't use?<br />
<br />
Thats how we ended up on bed .............]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Alcohol testing</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[In an alcohol factory the regular tester died and the director started looking for a new one to hire.<br />
<br />
A drunkard with a ragged, dirty look came to apply for the position. <br />
<br />
The director of the factory wondered how to send him away. They tested him.<br />
<br />
They gave him a glass with a drink. He tried it and said, "It's red wine, a muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers."<br />
<br />
"That's correct", said the boss.<br />
<br />
Another glass. "It's red wine, cabernet, eight years old, a south western slope, oak barrels."<br />
<br />
"Correct." The director was astonished. He winked at his secretary to suggest something. <br />
<br />
She brought in a glass of urine. The alcoholic tried it.<br />
<br />
"It's a blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant, made inside the office. And if you don't give me the job, I'll also tell who's the father!"<br />
<br />
The boss collapsed...]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Indian vs American</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[In a New York sidewalk, an Indian is enjoying a hearty breakfast "Coffee, croissants, toast, butter, jam, etc"<br />
<br />
While an American, chewing a gum, sat next to him and started an unwanted conversation.<br />
<br />
American: You Indians eat the whole bread?<br />
Indian: Ofcourse!<br />
American: (Blowing bubbles with his gum) we don't. We, Americans only eat what's inside. The crust we collect in a container, recycle, make these into croissants and sell these to  India.<br />
American: Do you eat jam with bread?<br />
Indian: Ofcourse!<br />
American: (Chuckling and crackling his gum between his teeth) We don't.<br />
Americans eat fruits at breakfast, put all the peels, seeds and leftovers into containers, turn these into jam and sell it to India.<br />
<br />
Indian: Do you have sex in America?<br />
American: Ofcourse, we do!<br />
Indian: What do you do with the condoms?<br />
American: We throw them, of course!<br />
Indian: We don't. In India, we put them into containers, recycle them, turn them into chewing gums and sell them to America!]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Magic Penis</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A businessman was preparing to go on a long business trip, so he thought he'd buy his wife something to keep her occupied.<br />
<br />
He went to a sex shop and explained his situation.  <br />
<br />
The man there said, Well, I don't know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except... The Magic Penis!<br />
<br />
The husband said, 'The what'? <br />
The man repeated, 'The Magic Penis,'  and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary  dildo.<br />
<br />
The husband laughed, and said, 'It looks like a dildo!'<br />
<br />
The man then pointed to the door and said, ' Magic Penis,  door!'<br />
The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started pounding away at the keyhole.  The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so much so,  that a crack began to form down the middle.  <br />
Then the man said, 'Magic Penis, return to box!' and the penis stopped and returned to the  box.<br />
<br />
The husband bought it  and took it home to his wife.<br />
After the husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Magic Penis.<br />
She undressed, opened the box and said 'Magic Penis, my vagina.'<br />
The penis shot to her crotch.  It was absolutely incredible.  After three mind shattering orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had enough.  <br />
<br />
She tried to pull it  out, but it was stuck.  Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off so she put her  clothes on, got in her car and started for the closest hospital.<br />
<br />
On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve all over the road.  A Police Officer saw this and immediately pulled her over.  He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.<br />
<br />
Gasping and twitching, the woman said, 'I haven't had anything to drink officer. You see, I've got this Magic Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me.'<br />
<br />
The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, 'Yeah right...  Magic Penis, my ass...!!!!!!!!!!']]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>lessons of life</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[#...Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself..<br />
Moral: In life no one helps you, once you're fucked.<br />
<br />
#...Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.<br />
<br />
#...What is the difference between frustration and satisfaction?<br />
What the Fuck! and What a Fuck!<br />
<br />
#...3 people having sex is a threesome, 2 is a twosome. So next time someone calls you 'HANDSOME', don't take it as a compliment!<br />
<br />
#...Life is like a dick, sometimes it becomes hard for no reason.<br />
<br />
#...Practical thought:<br />
A husband is supposed to make his wife's panties wet, not her eyes. A wife is supposed to make her husband's dick hard, not his life..???]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A Neta has heart attack, dies, goes to hell, Devil waiting for him.<br />
<br />
"I'm not sure what to do." says Devil. "Ur on my list, but I have no room for you. As u definitely have to stay here, I'm going to have to let someone else go."<br />
<br />
"I got 3 folks here who weren't as bad as u. I will let 1 of them go, u hav to take their place. I let u decide who leaves!"<br />
<br />
Neta agrees.<br />
<br />
Devil opened 1st room.<br />
<br />
In it was Gangster and large pool of hot water. He kept diving in and climbing out, over and over. Such was his fate in hell.<br />
<br />
"No!' said Neta. 'I'm not a good swimmer!"<br />
<br />
Devil led him to next room. In it was Banta with a sledgehammer and room full of rocks. All he did was swing the hammer, time after time.<br />
<br />
"No! I got problem with my shoulder. I will be in constant agony if I had to break rocks all day."<br />
<br />
Devil opened 3rd door. Neta saw Banta lying on a King Size Bed, arms over his head, legs full spread. Over him was Sunny Leone, bent down, between his legs doing what she is best at.<br />
<br />
Neta looked in disbelief for a while and says, "Yeah, I can handle this."<br />
<br />
The Devil smiled and said, "OK, Sunny, you are free to Go!!"]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Joe and John</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[There were two twins, Joe and John. Joe was the owner of a old dilapidated boat. It just so happened that John's wife died the same day Joe's boat sank. A few days later a kindly old woman saw Joe, and mistaking him for John. Said "I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You must feel terrible" <br />
<br />
Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat, said "Fact is, I'm sort of glad to get rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like an old dead fish. She was always losing her water, she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front, too. Every time I used her the hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy. I guess what finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time for the weekend. I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow and were willing to pay. The fools all tried to get in her at the same time and split her right down the middle." <br />
<br />
The old woman fainted. ]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A husband and wife decided they needed to use "code" to indicate that they wanted to have sex without letting their children in on it. <br />
<br />
They decided on the word "typewriter". <br />
<br />
One day the husband told his five year old daughter, "Go tell your mommy that daddy needs to type a letter". <br />

The child told her mother what her dad said and her mom responded, "Tell your daddy that he can't type a letter right now because there is a red ribbon in the typewriter." <br />
<br />
The child went back to tell her father what mommy said. <br />
<br />
A few days later the mom told the daughter, "Tell daddy that he can type that letter now." <br />
<br />
The child told her father, who returned to her mother and announced, "Daddy said never mind with the typewriter, he already wrote the letter by hand".]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>3 daughters</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A Mother had 3 virgin daughters... <br />
<br />
They were all getting married within a short time period. <br />
<br />
Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. <br />
<br />
The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding. The card said nothing but "Nescafe." Mom was puzzled at first, but then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: "Good till the last drop." Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. <br />
<br />
The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: "Benson&Hedges". Mom now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson&Hedges pack: "Extra Long King Size." She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter. <br />
<br />
The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mom waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words: "British Airways". Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for the airline. <br />
The ad said: "Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways." (Mom fainted)]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Hypothetical vs Reality</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A little boy goes up to his father and asks: "Dad, what's the difference<br />
between hypothetical and reality?"<br />
<br />
The father replies: "Well son, I could give you the book definitions, but I<br />
feel it could be best to show you by example. Go upstairs and ask your mother<br />
if she'd have sex with the mailman for $500,000."<br />
<br />
The boy goes and asks his mother: "Mom, would you have sex with the mailman<br />
for $500,000?" The mother replies: "Hell yes I would!"<br />
<br />
The little boy returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'"<br />
<br />
The father then says: "Okay, now go and ask your older sister if she'd have<br />
sex with her principal for $500,000."<br />
<br />
The boy asks his sister: "Would you have sex with your principal for<br />
$500,000?" The sister replies: "Hell yes I would!"<br />
<br />
He returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'"<br />
<br />
The father answers: "Okay son, here's the deal: Hypothetically, we're<br />
millionaires, but in reality, we're just living with a couple of whores."]]></PostContent>

She sent him a Thank you note on email.<br />
Bosses wife read the mail and filed a divorce in court.<br />
<br />
The mail says:<br />
<br />
"Your penis wonderful. I enjoyed using it last night.<br />
It has extra ordinary smooth flow, and a firm stroke.<br />
Initially its tip was to be licked to bring to working order &<br />
it is equally good on both sides.<br />
I loved its perfect size and grip. Felt like I was in heaven when using it.<br />
I've always desired it and you fulfilled my wish.<br />
At last it is mine and mine for ever.<br />
Thanks a lot"<br />

<PostTitle>Girls Night Out</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Two women friends had gone out for a Girls Night Out, and had been decidedly over-enthusiastic on the cocktails. Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.<br />
<br />
The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, "These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties." "That's nothing," said the other. "Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, We'll never forget you!']]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>$200</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Johnny wanted to have sex with a girl in his office, but she belonged to someone else...<br />
<br />
One day, Johnny got so frustrated that he went up to her and said, "I'll give you a $100 if you let me<br />
screw you. <br />
But the girl said NO.<br />
Johnny said, "I'll be fast. I'll throw the money on the floor, you bend down, and I'll be finished by the time you pick it up. "<br />
<br />
She thought for a moment and said that she would have to consult her boyfriend... So she called her boyfriend and told him the story.<br />
Her boyfriend says, "Ask him for $200, pick up the money very fast, he won't even be able to get his pants down."<br />
<br />
So she agrees and accepts the proposal. Half an hour goes by, and the boyfriend is waiting for his girlfriend to call.<br />
Finally, after 45 minutes, the boyfriend calls and asks what happened.<br />
<br />
She responded, "The idiot used coins!"]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>A young man and his date</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A young man and his date were parked on a back road some distance from town. They were about to have sex when the girl stopped.<br />
<br />
"I really should have mentioned this earlier, but I'm actually a hooker and I charge $20 for sex." The man reluctantly paid her, and they did their thing.<br />
<br />
After a cigarette, the man just sat in the driver's seat looking out the window. "Why aren't we going anywhere?" asked the girl.<br />
<br />
"Well, I should have mentioned this before, but I'm actually a taxi driver, and the fare back to town is $25..."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Santa buys a Harley Davidson</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Santa is shopping for a new motorcycle. He finally finds one for a great price, but its missing a seal, so whenever it rains he has to smear vaseline over the spot where the seal should be..<br />
<br />
Anyway, his girlfriend is having him over for dinner to meet her parents. He drives his new bike to her house, where she is outside waiting for him..<br />
<br />
"No matter what happens at dinner tonight, don't say a word." She tells him, "Our family had a fight a while ago about doing dishes. We haven't done any since, but the first person to speak at dinner has to do them.."<br />
<br />
Santa sits down for dinner and it is just how she described it. Dishes are piled up to the ceiling in the kitchen, and nobody is saying a word. So Santa decides to have a little fun. He grabs his girlfriend, throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of her parents..<br />
<br />
His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word. A few minutes later he grabs her mom, throws her on the table and does a repeat performance. Now his girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, and her mother is a little happier.<br />
But still there is complete silence at the table. All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain. Santa remembers his motorcycle. He jumps up and grabs his jar of vaseline..<br />
<br />
Upon witnessing this, his girlfriend's father backs away from the table and screams, "OKAY, ENOUGH ALREADY, ILL DO THE FUCKING DISHES.."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>20 years after marriage</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A woman awakes during the night to find that her husband was not in bed. She goes downstairs to look for him. She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in front of him.<br />
<br />
He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee.<br />
<br />
"What's the matter, dear?" she whispers as she steps into the room. "Why are you down here at this time of night? "<br />
<br />
The husband looks up from his coffee, "Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only 18?" he asks solemnly.<br />
<br />
"Yes I do" she replies.<br />
<br />
The husband pauses; the words were not coming easily. "Do you remember when your father caught us in the garden?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, I remember" said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.<br />
<br />
The husband continued.. "Do you remember when he showed the shotgun in my face and said, 'Either you marry my daughter, or I'll send you to jail for 20 years?"<br />
<br />
"I remember that too" she replied softly.<br />
<br />
He wiped another tear from his cheek and said, "I would have been released today..]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Priest and Nun in desert</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A nun and a priest were crossing the Sahara desert on a camel. On the third day, the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning.<br />
After dusting themselves off, the Nun and the Priest surveyed their situation. After a long period of silence, the Priest spoke. 'Well, Sister, this looks pretty grim.'<br />
'I know, Father. In fact, I don't think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two..'<br />
'I agree,' says the Father. 'Sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?'<br />
'Anything, Father.'<br />
'I have never seen a woman's breasts and I was wondering if I might see yours.'<br />
'Well, under the circumstances I don't see that it would do any harm.'<br />
The Nun opened her habit and the Priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.<br />
'Sister, would you mind if I touched them?'...<br />
She consented and he fondled them for several minutes.<br />
'Father, could I ask something of you?'<br />
'Yes, Sister?'<br />
'I have never seen a man's penis. Could I see yours?'<br />
'I suppose that would be OK,' the Priest replied lifting his robe.<br />
'Oh Father, may I touch it?'<br />
The priest consented and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting a huge erection.<br />
'Sister, you know that if I insert my penis in the right place, it can Give Life.'<br />
'Is that true Father?'<br />
'Yes, it is, Sister.'<br />
'Oh Father, that's wonderful ... Stick it in the camel and let's get the hell out of here!']]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Handjob</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A guy walks into a pub and sees a sign hanging over the bar which reads:<br />
Cheese Sandwich: - Rs. 50<br />
Chicken Sandwich: - Rs. 100<br />
Hand Job: - Rs.500.<br />
<br />
After checking his wallet for the necessary payment, he walks up to the bar and beckons one of the three exceptionally attractive blondes serving drinks to an eager-looking group of men.<br />
<br />
"Yes?" she inquires with a knowing smile, "Can I help you?"<br />
<br />
"I was wondering", whispers the man, "Are you the one who gives the hand-jobs?"<br />
<br />
"Yes", she purrs, "indeed I am"<br />
<br />
The man replies "Well wash your hands, I want a cheese sandwich!"]]></PostContent>
