<PostTitle>Camel</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[There was a guy riding through the desert on his camel. He had been travelling so long that he felt the need to have sex. <br />
Obviously there were no women in the desert so the man turned to his camel. <br />
<br />
He tried to position himself to have sex with his camel but the camel ran away. The man ran to catch up to the camel and got back on and started to ride again. <br />
Soon he was feeling the urge to have sex again so once again he turned to his camel. The camel refused by running away. So he caught up to it again and go on it again.<br />
<br />
Finally after riding the camel through the whole desert the man came to a road. There was a broken down car with three big chested beautiful blondes sitting in it. <br />
He went up to them and asked the women if they needed any help...<br />
<br />
The hottest girl said ,If you fix our car we will do anything you want...<br />
<br />
The man luckily knew a thing or two about cars and fixed it in a flash.<br />
When he finished are three girls asked, How could we ever repay you Mr.? <br />
<br />
After thinking for a short while he replied,.. Could you hold my camel...]]></PostContent>

</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A husband, one bright sunny morning, turns to his lovely wife...<br />
Wife, we're going fishing this weekend, you, me and the dog...<br />
<br />
The wife grimaces, But I don't like fishing !<br />
Look! We're going fishing and that's final...<br />
Do I have to go fishing with you... I really don't want to go !<br />
Right... I'll give you three choices... <br />
1. You come fishing with me and the dog... <br />
2. You give me a BLOW JOB.... <br />
3. or you take it up the ass ! <br />
<br />
The wife grimaces again, But I don't want to do any of those things !<br />
Wife I've given you three options.. You'll HAVE to do one of them! <br />
I'm going to the garage to sort out my fishing tackle, when I come back I expect you to have made up your mind!<br />
<br />
The wife sits and thinks about it. <br />
Twenty minutes later her husband comes back, Well! What have you decided ? FISHING with me and the dog, BLOW JOB, or ass ??<br />
<br />
The wife complains some more and finally makes up her mind, O.K. I'll give you a blow job !!<br />
<br />
Great ! He says and drops his pants. The wife is on her knees doing the business. <br />
Suddenly she stops, looks up at her Husband, Oh! It tastes absolutely disgusting... It tastes all shitty !!!<br />
<br />
Yes ! says her husband...<br />
The dog didn't want to go fishing either....]]></PostContent>

</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A married couple both lost jobs, and were having a hard time finding new jobs. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, their mounting credit card debt required some immediate income. <br />
<br />
The wife suggested that she could whore herself out, but her husband was a little less than thrilled about the prospect...<br />
<br />
But financial necessities got the best of her, and she went behind her husband's back to go whoring.<br />
 <br />
She came back one night with a huge wad of cash, and fessed up to her hubby. <br />
<br />
He was upset, but asked how much she made ???<br />
<br />
$398.25cents she said....<br />
<br />
Who paid 25 cents?? he asked. <br />
<br />
Everybody..... !!!]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Smart Student</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A beautiful Madam was having trouble with one of her students in 1st Grade class. Madam asked,'Boy. What is your problem?'<br />
<br />
Boy answered, 'I'm too smart for the first-grade. My sister is in the third-grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 4th Grade!'<br />
<br />
Madam had enough. She took the Boy to the principal's office. While the Boy waited in the outer office, madam explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Madam he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave. She agreed.<br />
<br />
the Boy was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.<br />
<br />
Principal: 'What is 3 x 3?' Boy.: '9 .<br />
<br />
Principal: 'What is 6 x 6?' Boy.: '36 .<br />
<br />
And so it went with every question the principal thought a 4th grade should know. The principal looks at Madam and tells her, 'I think Boy can go to the 4th grade.'<br />
<br />
Madam says to the principal, 'I have some of my own questions.<br />
<br />
Can I ask him ?' The principal and Boy both agreed.<br />
<br />
Madam asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of'?<br />
<br />
Boy, after a moment 'Legs.'<br />
<br />
Madam: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?'<br />
<br />
Boy.: 'Pockets.'<br />
<br />
Madam: What starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid?<br />
<br />
Boy.: Coconut<br />
<br />
Madam: What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft And sticky?<br />
<br />
The principal's eyes open really wide and before he could stop the answer, Boy was taking charge.<br />
<br />
Boy.: Bubblegum<br />
<br />
Madam: What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?<br />
<br />
The principal's eyes open really wide and before he could stop the answer...<br />
<br />
Boy.: Shake hands<br />
<br />
Madam: You stick your poles inside me. You tie me down to get me up. I get wet before you do.<br />
<br />
Boy.: Tent<br />
<br />
Madam: A finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The best man always has me first.<br />
<br />
The Principal was looking restless, a bit tense and took one large Patiala Vodka peg.<br />
<br />
Boy.: Wedding Ring<br />
<br />
Madam: I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me, you feel good.<br />
<br />
Boy.: Nose<br />
<br />
Madam: I have a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates. I come with a quiver.<br />
<br />
Boy.: Arrow<br />
<br />
Madam: What word starts with a 'F' and ends in 'K' that means lot of heat and excitement?<br />
<br />
Boy.: Fire truck<br />
<br />
Madam: What word starts with a 'F' and ends in 'K' and if u don't get it, u have to use ur hand.<br />
<br />
Boy.: Fork<br />
<br />
Madam: What is it that all men have one of it's longer on some men than on others, the pope doesn't use his and a man gives it to his wife after they're married?<br />
<br />
Boy.: SURNAME.<br />
<br />
Madam: What part of the man has no bone but has muscles, has lots of veins, like pumping, and is responsible for making love ?<br />
<br />
Boy.: HEART.<br />
<br />
The principal breathed a sigh of relief and said to the teacher,<br />
<br />
'Send this Boy to IIM AHMEDABAD, I got the last ten questions wrong myself!'... ????]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Types of sex</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[There are four types of sex in a marriage:<br />
<br />
Kitchen Sex:<br />
This is at the beginning of the marriage; you'll have sex anywhere, anytime. Hence, in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Bedroom Sex:<br />
You've calmed down a bit, perhaps have kids, so you gotta do it in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Hallway Sex:<br />
This is where you pass each other in the hallway and say, "Fuck you."<br />
<br />
Courtroom Sex:<br />
This is when you get divorced and your wife fucks you in front of everyone in court.]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>60 minutes</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A guy was talking to his buddy at the bar, and he said, "I don't have a clue what to get my wife for her birthday - she has everything, and besides, she can afford to buy anything she wants, so I'm stumped." <br />
<br />
His buddy said, "I have an idea - why don't you make up a certificate saying she can have 60 minutes of great sex, any way she wants it - she'll probably be thrilled." <br />
<br />
So that's what Guy did. <br />
<br />
The next day at the bar his buddy said, "Well? Did you take my suggestion?" <br />
<br />
"Yes, I did," said Joe. <br />
<br />
"Did she like it?" His buddy asked. <br />
<br />
"Oh yes! she jumped up , thanked me, kissed me on the forehead and ran out the door, yelling "I'll be back in an hour!!"]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A young woman was preparing for her wedding. She asked her mother to go out and buy a nice long black negligee and carefully place it in her suitcase so it would not wrinkle. Well, mom forgot until the last minute.<br />
<br />
She dashed out and could only find a short pink nightie. She bought it and threw it into the suitcase.<br />
<br />
After the wedding, the bride and groom entered their hotel room. The groom was a little self-conscious, so he asked his new bride to change in the bathroom and promise not to peek while he got ready for bed.<br />
<br />
While she was in the bathroom, the bride opened her suitcase and saw the negligee her mother had thrown in there. "Oh no! It's short, pink, and wrinkled!" She exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Then her groom cried out, "I told you not to peek!"]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>politics</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Son: "Daddy, I have to write a special report for school, but I don't know what politics is."<br />
<br />
Father: "Well, let's take our home as an example. I am the bread-winner, so let's call me Capitalism. Your Mum is the administrator of money, so we'll call her Government. We take care of your need, so let's call you The People. We'll call the maid the Working Class and your brother we can call The Future. Do you understand son?"<br />
<br />
Son: "I'm not really sure, Dad. I'll have to think about it."<br />
<br />
That night awakened by his brother's crying, the boy went to see what was wrong. Discovering that the baby had seriously soiled his diaper, the boy went to his parents' room and found his mother sound asleep. He went to the maid's room, where, peeking through the keyhole, he saw his father in bed with the maid. The boy's knocking went totally unheeded by his father and the maid, so the boy returned to his room and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning he reported to his father.<br />
<br />
Son: "Dad, now I think I understand what Politics is."<br />
<br />
Father: "Good son! Can you explain it to me in your own words?"<br />
<br />
Son: "Well Dad, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, Government is sound asleep, the People are being completely ignored and the Future is full of $hit."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>blonde goes to pet store</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A beautiful blonde goes to her local pet store in search of an 'exotic' pet.. As she looks about the store, she notices a box FULL of frogs.<br />
<br />
The sign says: 'SEX FROGS' Only $20 each! Comes with 'complete' instructions.<br />
<br />
The girl excitedly looks around to see if anybody's watching her. She whispers softly to the man behind the counter, 'I'll TAKE one!'<br />
<br />
As the man packages the frog, he quietly says to her, 'Just follow the instructions!' The blonde nods, grabs the box, and is quickly on her way home.<br />
<br />
As soon as she closes the door to her apartment, she opens the instructions and reads them very carefully. She does EXACTLY what is specified:<br />
<br />
1. Take a shower. 2. Splash on some nice perfume. 3. Slip into a very sexy nightie. 4. Crawl into bed and place the frog down beside you, and allow the frog to do what he has been trained to do.<br />
<br />
She then quickly gets into bed with the frog and, to her surprise, . . . NOTHING happens! The blonde is very disappointed and quite upset at this point. She re-reads the instructions and notices at the bottom of the paper it says, 'If you have any problems or questions, please call the pet store.'<br />
<br />
So, she calls the pet store. The man says, 'I'll be right over.' Within minutes, the man is ringing her doorbell. The blonde welcomes him in and says, 'See, I've done everything according to the instructions. The damn frog just SITS there!'<br />
<br />
The man . . . looking very concerned, picks up the frog, stares 'directly into its eyes' and STERNLY says: 'LISTEN TO ME U bastard! I'm only going to show you how to do this....<br />
ONE ... LAST ... TIME!!!]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>awesome grandma</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Lulu was a prostitute, but she didn't want her grandma to know.<br />
<br />
One day, the police raided the brothel and took all the girls outside and made them line up.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Lulu's grandma came by and Grandma asked, "Why are you standing in line here, dear?<br />
<br />
"Not willing to let her grandma know the truth, Lulu told her that the police were passing out free oranges and she was just lining up for some.<br />
<br />
"Why, that's awfully nice of them. I think I'll get some for myself,"<br />
<br />
Grandma said, and she proceeded to the back of the line.<br />
<br />
A policeman was going down the line asking for information from all the prostitutes. When he got to grandma, he was bewildered and exclaimed, "Wow, still going at it at your age?<br />
<br />
How do you do it, old girl?<br />
<br />
"Grandma replied, "Oh, it's easy, dear. I just take my dentures out, rip the skin back and suck em' dry."<br />
<br />
The policeman fainted.]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Professor attention</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Mindblowing.......<br />
<br />
1st yr MBBS students were attending their 1st anatomy class. They all gathered around the table with real dead body. The professor started the class by telling them two important qualities as a doctor. The 1st is that never be disgusted about anything regarding the body e.g. he inserted his finger in the body's ass and on drawing back, put the finger in his own mouth and tasted it. Then he told the students to do the same. The students hesitated for several minutes, but eventually everyone inserted their fingers in the body's ass and tasted it. When everyone finished the professor looked at them and said :The most important 2nd quality is Observation. I inserted my middle finger but tasted the index finger. Now learn to pay attention<br />
<br />
All Students : BHENCHOD !!!!!!!!!!!]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A baby was born who was so advanced he could talk.<br />
<br />
He looked around the delivery room and saw the doctor.<br />
<br />
"Are you my doctor?" he asked.<br />
<br />
"Yes, I am," said the doctor.<br />
<br />
The baby said, "Thank you for taking such good care of me during the birth."<br />

He looked at his mother and asked, "Are you my mother?"<br />

"Yes, I am," said the mother.<br />

<PostContent><![CDATA[On a golf tour in Ireland, Tiger Woods drives his Mercedes into a petrol station in a remote part of the Irish countryside.<br />
<br />
The pump attendant who knows absolutely nothing about golf, greets him in a typical Irish manner completely unaware of who the golfing pro is.<br />
<br />
"Top of the mornin' toyer, sir" says the attendant.<br />
<br />
Tiger nods a quick "hello" and bends forward to pick up the nozzle. As he does so, two tees fall out of his shirt pocket onto the ground.<br />
<br />
"What are those?", asks the attendant.<br />
<br />
"They're called tees" replies Tiger.<br />
<br />
"Well, what on this god's earth are dey for?" inquires the Irishman.<br />
<br />
"They're for resting my balls on when I'm driving", says Tiger.<br />
<br />
"Fookin' Jaysus", says the Irishman, "Mercedes thinks of everything!"]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Loose and Floppy Lips</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A sexually active woman tells her plastic surgeon that she wanted her vaginal lips reduced in size as they were too loose and floppy. She insisted that the surgery be kept a secret.<br />
<br />
Awakening after the surgery she found 3 roses carefully placed beside her on the bed.<br />
<br />
Outraged, she immediately calls in the doctor, "I thought I asked you not to tell anyone about my operation!"<br />
<br />
The surgeon told her he had carried out her wish for confidentiality and that the first rose was from him.<br />
<br />
"The second rose is from my nurse. She assisted me in the surgery"<br />
<br />
"And what about the third rose?" she asked.<br />
<br />
"That's from a man upstairs in the burn unit. He wanted to thank you for his new ears." ]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Breast Enlargement</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A flat-chested young lady went to Dr. Smith about enlarging her breasts.<br />
<br />
Dr. Smith advised her, "Every day after your shower, rub your chest and say, 'Scooby doobie doobies, I want bigger boobies!'"<br />
<br />
She did this faithfully for several months! To her utter amazement she grew terrific D-cup boobs!<br />
<br />
One morning she was running late, got on the bus, and in a panic realized she had forgotten her morning ritual. Frightened she might lose her lovely boobs if she didn't recite the little rhyme, she stood right there in the middle aisle of the bus, closed her eyes and said, "Scooby doobie, doobies, I want bigger boobies."<br />
<br />
A guy sitting nearby looked at her and asked, "Oh! Are you a patient of Dr. Smith's?"<br />
<br />
"Yes I am.. How did you know?"<br />
<br />
He winked and replied, "Hickory dickory dock...."]]></PostContent>

Santa " total 11 railway crossings, 4 unmanned and 7 manned crossings. Of the 7 manned crossings 4 are male 3 are female."<br />
<br />
After a brief silence the inquiry commission asked " what do you mean 'male' and 'female' crossing?"<br />
<br />
To which the Santa replied "where the barrier pole goes up we call it male and where the gates spread open we call it female!!!<br />
<br />

<PostTitle>PAINLESS DELIVERY</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A married couple went to have their baby delivered...<br />
Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. <br />
He asked if they were willing to try it out. <br />
They were both very much in favor of it. <br />
The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. <br />
However as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. <br />
The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. <br />
The husband was still feeling fine. <br />
The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. <br />
At this point, they decided to try for 50%. <br />
The husband continued to feel quite well. <br />
Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. <br />
The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. <br />
She and her husband were ecstatic... <br />
When they got home, they found the cook dead in the kitchen.]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[Two dwarfs go into a bar, where they pick up two prostitutes and take them to their separate hotel rooms.<br />
  <br />
The first dwarf, however, is unable to get an erection. <br />
His depression is made worse by the fact that, from the next room, he hears his little friend shouting out cries of .. Here I come again ...ONE, TWO, THREE...UUH ... all night long.  <br />
<br />
In the morning, the second dwarf asks the first, How did it go?? <br />
<br />
The first mutters, It was so embarrassing. I simply couldn't get a hard on.  <br />
<br />
The second dwarf shook his head. You think that's embarrassing ???<br />
I couldn't even get on the fucking bed ]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>story of sperm</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[The newly born sperm was receiving instructions in conception from the instructor...<br />
<br />
As soon as you hear the siren, run for the tunnel and swim in a straight line until you get to the entrance of a damp cavern...<br />
At the end of the cavern you will find a red, sticky ball which is the egg....<br />
Address it and say, 'I'm a Sperm.' She will answer, 'I'm an Egg.'...<br />
From that moment on you will work together to create the embryo. Do you understand ?? <br />
The sperm nodded affirmatively...<br />
<br />
Two days later, the sperm is taking a nap when he hears the siren. <br />
<br />
He wakes immediately and runs to the tunnel. <br />
A multitude of sperm swim behind him. <br />
He knows he has to arrive first. <br />
When he nears the entrance to the cavern, he looks back and sees that he is far ahead of the other sperm. <br />
He is able to swim at a slower pace but does approach the red, sticky ball. <br />
When, at last, he reaches the red, sticky ball, he smiles and says....<br />
<br />
Hi, I'm a sperm ...<br />
The red sticky ball smiles and says, Hi. I'm a tonsil....]]></PostContent>

Mother, where do babies come from??<br />

The mother thinks for a few seconds and says, Well dear, Mommy and Daddy fall in love and get married. One night they go into their bedroom, they kiss and hug and have sex.<br />
The daughter looks puzzled so the mother continues, That means the daddy puts his penis in the mommy's vagina. That?s how you get a baby, honey. The child seems to comprehend.<br />
<br />
Oh, I see, but the other night when I came into your room you had daddy's penis in your mouth. <br />
What do you get when you do that?<br />

<PostTitle>The Polite Way to Pee</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[During one of her daily classes, a teacher trying to teach good manners, asked her students the following question:<br />
<br />
Michael, if you were on a date having dinner with a nice young lady, how would you tell her that you have to go to the bathroom?<br />
<br />
Michael said: 'Just a minute I have to go pee.'<br />
<br />
The teacher responded by saying: 'That would be rude and impolite'<br />
<br />
What about you Sherman, how would you say it?'<br />
<br />
Sherman said: 'I am sorry, but I really need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.'<br />
<br />
'That's better, but it's still not very nice to say the word bathroom at the dinner table.<br />
<br />
And you, little Johnny, can you use your brain for once and show us your good manners?<br />
<br />
Johnny said: 'I would say: Darling, may I please be excused for a moment? I have to shake hands with a very dear friend of mine, whom I hope to introduce to you after dinner.'<br />
<br />
The teacher fainted...?]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A farmer rears  25 young hens and one old cock ...<br />
As he feels that the old cock could no longer handle his job efficiently, the farmer bought one young cock from the market...<br />
<br />
Old cock to Young cock : Welcome to join me, we will work together towards productivity...<br />
<br />
Young cock: What do you mean As far as I know, you are old and should be retired.<br />
<br />
Old cock : Young boy, there are 25 hens here, can't I help you with some<br />
<br />
Young cock: No!! Not even one, all of them will be mine.<br />
<br />
Old cock: In this case, I shall challenge you to a competition and if I win you shall allow me to have one hen and if I lose you will have all...<br />
<br />
Young cock:  OKKK.. What kind of competition?<br />
<br />
Old cock: 50 meters run. From here to that tree. But due to my age, I hope you allow me to start off the first 10 meters.<br />
<br />
Young cock: No problem ! We will compete tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
In the morning the Young cock allows the Old cock to start off and when the Old cock crosses the 10 meters mark the Young cock chases him with all his might.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, he was behind the Old cock's back in a matter of seconds. <br />
<br />
Suddenly..."BANG" !!! <br />
<br />
Before he could overtake the old cock, he was shot dead by the farmer ...<br />
who cursed, : "Hell" <br />
<br />
This is the 5th GAY cock I've bought this week." <br />

<PostTitle>Pretend that we are married</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A man and a woman who have never met before find themselves in the same sleeping carriage of a train. <br />
<br />
After the initial embarrassment they both go to sleep, the man on the top bunk, the woman on the lower. <br />
<br />
In the middle of the night the man leans over, wakes the woman and says, "I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm awfully cold and I was wondering if you could possibly get me another blanket?" <br />
<br />
The woman leans out and, with a glint in her eye, says, " I have a better idea, just for tonight, let's make pretend that we're married!" <br />
<br />
The man says happily, "OK!" AWESOME!" <br />
<br />
The woman says, "GOOD .... Get your own fucking blanket!!!]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[A man is out shopping and discovers a new brand of Olympic condoms. Clearly impressed, he buys a pack. <br />
<br />
Upon getting home he announces to his wife the purchase he just made. "Olympic condoms?"<br />
<br />
she blurts, "What makes them so special?" <br />
"There is three colors", he replies, "Gold, Silver and Bronze." <br />
"What color are you going to wear tonight?", she asks cheekily. <br />
"Gold of course", says the man proudly. <br />

The wife responds really, "Why don't you wear Silver, it would be nice if you came second for a change!".]]></PostContent>

<br />
The preacher who lived across the street saw the beer and came over to harass the kid. "Aren't you a little young to be drinking, son?" he asked. <br />
<br />
"That's nothing," the kid said after taking a swig of beer. "I got laid when I was three." <br />

"What? How did that happen?" <br />

"I don't remember. I was drunk."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Long n deadly</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years. <br />
<br />
He eventually decides to go and see a doctor. The doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration.<br />
<br />
You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.<br />
<br />
Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. <br />
<br />
As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new suit.' <br />
He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new suit.' The elderly tailor eye d him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.' <br />
Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' <br />
'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said. <br />
<br />
Joe tried on the suit it fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?' <br />
Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.' The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.' <br />
Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' 'Been in the business 60 years.' <br />
Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly. <br />
<br />
Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new underwear?' Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..' The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36. Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..' <br />
The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache...<br />
<br />
New suit - $400 <br />
New shirt - $36 <br />
New underwear - $6 <br />
Second Opinion - PRICELESS.]]></PostContent>

</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A 70 year old man went to his doctor's office to get a sperm count. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, "Take this jar home and bring me back a sample tomorrow." The next day the 70 year old man reappears at the doctor's office and gives him the jar, which is as clean and empty as on - the previous day.<br />
<br />
The doctor asked what happened and the man explains: "Well, doc, it's like this: First I tried with my right hand, but, nothing. Then I tried with-my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She - tried with her right hand, with nothing. Then her left, but nothing. She - even tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with the teeth-out, and still nothing. We even called up the lady next door and-she tried with both hands and her mouth too, but nothing."<br />
<br />
The doctor was shocked! "You asked your neighbor?"<br />
the old man replied, "yep, but no matter what we tried we couldn't get the DARN jar open!"]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>do you have a vagina?</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[A woman is at home when she hears someone knock at the door. <br />
<br />
She goes to the door and opens the door to see a innocent man standing there.<br />
<br />
He asks the lady, 'Do you have a vagina?'<br />
<br />
She slams the door in disgust.<br />
<br />
The next morning she hears a knock at the door and it is the same man and he asks the same question of the woman, 'Do you have a vagina?'<br />
<br />
She slams the door again.<br />
<br />
Later that night when her husband gets home she tells him what has happened for the last two days.<br />
<br />
The husband tells the wife in a loving and concerned voice 'Honey, I am taking tomorrow off to be home just in case this guy shows up again.'<br />
<br />
The next morning they hear a knock and both run for the door.<br />
<br />
The husband says to the wife in a whispered voice, 'Honey, I'm going to hide behind the door and listen and if it is the same guy I want you to answer yes to the question because I want to see where the bastard is going with it.'<br />
<br />
She nods yes to her husband and opens the door. Sure enough the same fellow is standing there and asks the same question; 'Do you have a vagina'?<br />
<br />
'Yes, actually I have,' she says... <br />
<br />
The man replies.. 'Good! Would you mind telling your husband to leave my wife's alone and start using yours?'?]]></PostContent>

<PostContent><![CDATA[On their first night to be together, the newlywed couple go to get changed. <br />
<br />
The new bride comes out of the bathroom, all showered and wearing her beautiful robe. <br />
The proud husband says, "My dear, we are married now, you can open your robe."<br />
The beautiful young woman opens her robe, and he is astonished. "Oh, oh, aaaahhh," he exclaims, "My word, you are so beautiful, let me take your picture. Puzzled, she asks, "My picture?"<br />
He answers, "Yes my dear, so I can carry your beauty next to my heart forever."<br />
She smiles and he takes her picture, and then he heads into the bathroom to shower.<br />
He comes out wearing his robe and the new wife asks, "Why do you wear a robe? We are married now."<br />
At that the man opens his robe and she exclaims, "Oh, oh, oh my, let me get a picture."<br />
He beams and asks, "Why?" She answers, "So I can get it enlarged."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>two black eyes</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[Jack was returning to work Monday morning with two black eyes. <br />
<br />
His workmates were understandably curious: "Jack, what happened to you ??" <br />
<br />
"It was the darndest thing! I was at church yesterday, and this fat lady stood up in front of me. You know how a dress can get stuck in the crack of the butt of a fat lady? It looked funny. I figured she wouldn't like that, so I just reached over and pulled it out with a little tug. Next thing I know, she spins around and socks me one!"<br />
<br />
"Jeez, you got TWO black eyes in one blow?"<br />
<br />
"Naw. After she turned back around, I figured she was angry that I pulled the dress out of her crack, so I tried to poke it back in..."]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>A damn good explanation</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[The wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman And she was upset.<br />
<br />
'You are a disrespectful pig!' she cried. 'How dare you do this to me -- a faithful wife, the mother of your children! I'm leaving you.<br />
<br />
I want a divorce right away ! And the husband replied, 'Hang on just a minute love, so at least I can tell you what happened.<br />
<br />
'Go ahead,' she sobbed,' but they'll be the last words you'll say to me!'<br />
<br />
And the husband began -- 'Well, I was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift.<br />
<br />
She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.<br />
<br />
I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty.<br />
<br />
She told me that she hadn't eaten for three days.<br />
<br />
So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night, the ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight.<br />
<br />
The poor thing devoured them in moments.<br />
<br />
Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes, so I threw them away.<br />
<br />
Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.<br />
<br />
I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't wear because I don't have good taste.<br />
<br />
I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her, and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair the same.<br />
<br />
'The husband took a quick breath and continued - 'She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said, 'Please, Do you have Anything else that your wife doesn't use?<br />
<br />
Thats how we ended up on bed .............]]></PostContent>

<PostTitle>Alcohol testing</PostTitle>
</PostData>
<PostContent><![CDATA[In an alcohol factory the regular tester died and the director started looking for a new one to hire.<br />
<br />
A drunkard with a ragged, dirty look came to apply for the position. <br />
<br />
The director of the factory wondered how to send him away. They tested him.<br />
<br />
They gave him a glass with a drink. He tried it and said, "It's red wine, a muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers."<br />
<br />
"That's correct", said the boss.<br />
<br />
Another glass. "It's red wine, cabernet, eight years old, a south western slope, oak barrels."<br />
<br />
"Correct." The director was astonished. He winked at his secretary to suggest something. <br />
<br />
She brought in a glass of urine. The alcoholic tried it.<br />
<br />
"It's a blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant, made inside the office. And if you don't give me the job, I'll also tell who's the father!"<br />
<br />
The boss collapsed...]]></PostContent>
